# Title     : Bio (for Bio Perlogical) or bio_lib.pl
# Usage     : require "Bio.pl"; ##<-- This is very slow, so you'd better
#             use Bio;   <-- When you have Bio.pm module installed
#
#             or, copy the subroutines in your prog. or make a smaller lib files
#               which are classified according to functions(like, Bio_Seq.pl
#               for sequence handling, Bio_Array.pl for various array
#               subroutines..), or make your own module out of this, do whatever
#               you want....
#
# Function  : 1) This is a comprehensive perl subroutine library developed
#                 under Bioperl project and others.
#                 URL: http://cyrah.med.harvard.edu/Bioperlsub/
#
#             2) The design of this module is for simple layer biological
#                 module than multilevel object oriented module.
#
#             3) This also serves as the depository database for various
#                 perl subroutines or algorithms developed in
#                 Bioinformatics and Genome projects.
#
#             4) You can copy any of the sub routines in this file, modify, use
#                 in yours...
#                 PLEASE MODIFY AS FREELY AS YOU WANT !! All has the
#                 same PERL copyright
#
#             5) All the subroutines are tested in small files
#                 If you want to have such single example program
#                 to see how they really work, pls contact me( A Biomatic )
#                 For example, a file called  'handle_arguments.pl' exists to
#                 test the subroutine 'handle_arguments'. Usually you can find them
#                 in  http://cyrah.med.harvard.edu/Bio.pl.html
#
# Example   : require "Bio.pl"; BUT, I recommand you take subroutines out and
#             use it directly or modify in your programs.
#             use Bio;
#
# Warning   : For the enhancement of Biology, Biomatics, and Science.
#             This is a development companion.
#             Class is for classification of my subroutines. If it is Bio, it can
#             be useful for biological sequence data handling. If it's Utility,
#             it can also be used for general purpose file handling stuff.
#             File, Array, Hash,... are my classification items.
# Keywords  : Biology, perl library, sequence handling lib
# Options   : nothing (used as subroutine library or as Bio.pm module)
